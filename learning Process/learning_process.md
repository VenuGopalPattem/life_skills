## Learning Process – Assignment 

### Question 1

- Choose a concept you want to learn.
- Study and understand the concept.
- Explain the concept in very simple language like teaching it to a child.
- Identify gaps or areas where you struggle to explain clearly.
- Re-learn and simplify the explanation until it becomes clear and easy to understand.

### Question 2

- The most interesting idea for me was the concept of two thinking modes – focused and diffused.

- Focused mode helps in concentrating deeply on a specific problem.

- Diffused mode helps in making broader connections between ideas.

- Taking breaks or relaxing activates the diffused mode.

- This helps the brain form stronger connections and solve difficult problems more creatively.
### Question 3

- Active mode of thinking is when we concentrate intensely on a specific problem and use logical, step-by-step reasoning.

- Diffused mode of thinking is when the brain is relaxed and making broader, creative connections between ideas, often happening during breaks, walks, or sleep.

### Question 4

1. Deconstruct the skill into smaller sub-skills.
2. Learn enough about each sub-skill to self-correct.
3. Remove practice barriers.
4. Practice for at least 20 hours with focused effort.

### Question 5

- Practice the Feynman Technique to improve deep understanding.

- Break complex topics into smaller, manageable parts.

- Study with full concentration and reduce distractions.

- Take structured breaks to balance focused and diffused thinking.

- Practice consistently with clear deadlines and regular revision.
