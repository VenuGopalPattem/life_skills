# Listening and Active Communication

<b> Question 1 </b>

### What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

- Leave your mind empty  
- focus on the speaker not on the sorroundings 
- Better not to intterupt speaker between let them finish their point
- Keep body in active position nod head if you understand or raise hand if not 
- Better to take notes in importatnt meetings beacuse while you are thinking to a point you may loose another 
- Use better phrases to interact with speaker like Yeah that was new thing, Yes we must work on that, Good idea, Nice suggestion
- Leave a question regarding to the topic showing your involvement

<b>Question 2</b>
### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? 

- First listen to speaker is trying to say and understand it 
- It is not good to ask questions in between it may interrupt the speaker flow, for questions there will be a dedicated time
- If you want you can rephrase the things what speaker said in your own words, shows how much did you understood
- Identify the emotion behind the words instead of just words, tells how desperate he was and importance of that topic
- It is always better to wrap up meeting to questions if you have then the silence even if you have a question 
- Avoid to judge the speaker 

<b> Question 3 </b>
### What are the obstacles in your listening process?

- I would mention my first obstacle as my overthinking which causes distraction of my own 
- I will also mention the surrounding atmosphere if it was too much clumsy 
- Having lack of clarity on particular new simple things and stop at that point and thinking is it real, how can I not know untill now..?
- So that type of thinking I might loose some key points next to that topic
- If concepts having more imaginating things then the real things I might stuck at my own thinking
- If any person next to me interrupts in between 

<b> Question 4 </b>
### What can you do to improve your listening?
- I consider reading books will improve our focus

- focusing on speaker by observing the body language and hand gestures of the speaker
